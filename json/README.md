# CodingTest: UI/UX Developer

The Product owner has asked you to design and create a web front-end against JSON data (included in this repo). The data includes details about `Users`, their `Posts` with `Comments`, and `Albums` with `Photos` which they have uploaded.

Please write a web application (HTML, JS, CSS) that meets the requirements detailed below. _Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks you want_; __[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)__ is recommended.

When done, zip up your solution and email it to [careers@finovertech.com](mailto:careers@finovertech.com). _Note: include any instructions on how to run your web app_.

## App Requirements from the Product owner

- Must be able to view all Posts with their details:
    - Post author (user)
    - Post time
    - Post title
    - Post body
    - All Comments for a Post (when it's clicked on):
        - Comment name
        - Comment email
        - Comment body

- Must be able to view all Albums with their details:
    - Album author (user)
    - Album title
    - All Photos for an Album (when it's clicked on):
        - image (full and/or thumb)
        - title

- Must be able to navigate the application without using the browser's navigation buttons (but those should also work!)
- Must be responsive (so it works on large and small screens)

## How Finovertech evaluates your submission

1. Following your provided "run" instructions, we launch your application
2. Your application is tested to prove that all requirements are met
3. As a group, we assess the overall flow of your application, looking at both structural and visual items
    - layout, navigation, colour theme(s), spacing/padding, etc.
    - Note: this is done as a group since we understand that everyone has a different opinion as to what looks and works good and what doesn't
4. Your code is evaluated by one or more developers here, looking at what frameworks were used and how the code is written and structured
